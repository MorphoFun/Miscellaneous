###  Reading in a data file directly from GitHub ###
# read.csv() and similar functions do not read https:// webaddresses,
# so here is a work-around to allow you to read data from GitHub
# using base functions.  

readGitHub <- function(url) {
	store <- tempfile()
	download.file(url, destfile=store, method="curl")
	dd <- read.csv(store)
	return(dd)
}
